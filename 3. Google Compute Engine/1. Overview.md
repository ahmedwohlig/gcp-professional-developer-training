# What is Google Compute Engine?

Secure and customizable compute service that lets you create and run virtual machines on Google’s infrastructure.

Compute Engine is a [computing and hosting service](https://cloud.google.com/docs/overview/cloud-platform-services#computing-hosting) that lets you create and run virtual machines on Google infrastructure. Compute Engine offers scale, performance, and value that lets you easily launch large compute clusters on Google's infrastructure. There are no upfront investments, and you can run thousands of virtual CPUs on a system that offers quick, consistent performance.

#### Use cases
###### Choosing the right virtual machine type

Whether you’re new to cloud computing, or just getting started on Google Cloud, these recommendations can help you optimize your Compute Engine usage and benefits. The table provides machine type recommendations for different workloads.

###### VM migration to Compute Engine

Compute Engine provides tools to help you bring your existing applications to the cloud. You can have your applications running on Compute Engine within minutes while your data migrates transparently in the background. Bring your existing applications from your physical servers, VMware vSphere, Amazon EC2, or Azure VMs.

###### BYOL or use license-included images

You can [run your Windows-based applications](https://cloud.google.com/windows) either by bringing your own licenses and running them in Compute Engine sole-tenant nodes or using a license-included image. After you migrate to Google Cloud, optimize or modernize your license usage to achieve your business goals. Take advantage of the many benefits available to virtual machine instances such as reliable storage options, the speed of the Google network, and autoscaling.

One has a box labeled VM2 and the other VM 4. A pink box labeled Customer 3 contains a box labeled VM3. Under these are two more boxes labeled Hypervisor and Host hardware. The box on the right is labeled Sole-tenant node. This contains four green boxes labeled Customer 1. Each of these boxes contains a box labeled VM 1, VM 2, VM 3, and VM 4. Under these are two more boxes labeled Hypervisor and Host hardware.](https://www.gstatic.com/bricks/image/d5c9cad33f729dc110d8b907db5a695ca9cf6b0f4b692f44f0f2c0e276d78369.svg)
