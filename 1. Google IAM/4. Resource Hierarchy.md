# Using resource hierarchy for access control

Google Cloud resources are organized hierarchically, where the organization node is the root node in the hierarchy, the projects are the children of the organization, and the other resources are descendants of projects. You can set allow policies at different levels of the resource hierarchy. Resources inherit the allow policies of the parent resource. The effective allow policy for a resource is the union of the allow policy set at that resource and the allow policy inherited from its parent.

This page describes some examples of how allow policy inheritance works and explains the best practices that you must take into consideration when you create resources during Identity and Access Management (IAM) deployment.
