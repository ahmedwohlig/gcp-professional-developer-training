# Using resource hierarchy for access control

Google Cloud resources are organized hierarchically, where the organization node is the root node in the hierarchy, the projects are the children of the organization, and the other resources are descendants of projects. You can set allow policies at different levels of the resource hierarchy. Resources inherit the allow policies of the parent resource. The effective allow policy for a resource is the union of the allow policy set at that resource and the allow policy inherited from its parent.

This page describes some examples of how allow policy inheritance works and explains the best practices that you must take into consideration when you create resources during Identity and Access Management (IAM) deployment.

IAM lets you set allow policies at the following levels of the resource hierarchy:

- **Organization level**. The organization resource represents your company. IAM roles granted at this level are inherited by all resources under the organization. For more information, see [Access control for organizations using IAM](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/access-control-org).
    
- **Folder level**. Folders can contain projects, other folders, or a combination of both. Roles granted at the highest folder level will be inherited by projects or other folders that are contained in that parent folder. For more information, see [Access control for folders using IAM](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/access-control-folders).
    
- **Project level**. Projects represent a trust boundary within your company. Services within the same project have a default level of trust. For example, App Engine instances can access Cloud Storage buckets within the same project. IAM roles granted at the project level are inherited by resources within that project. For more information, see [Access control for projects using IAM](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/access-control-proj).
    
- **Resource level**. In addition to the existing Cloud Storage and BigQuery ACL systems, additional resources such as Genomics Datasets, Pub/Sub topics, and Compute Engine instances support lower-level roles so that you can grant certain users permission to a single resource within a project.
    

Allow policies are hierarchical and propagate down the structure. The effective allow policy for a resource is the union of the allow policy set at that resource and the allow policy inherited from its parent.
