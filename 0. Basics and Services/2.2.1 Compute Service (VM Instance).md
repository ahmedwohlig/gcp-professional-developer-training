# Google Compute Engine

This page provides an overview of Compute Engine instances. An _instance_ is a virtual machine (VM) hosted on Google's infrastructure. You can [create an instance](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/create-start-instance) or [create a group of managed instances](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/creating-groups-of-managed-instances) by using the Google Cloud console, the Google Cloud CLI, or the Compute Engine API.

The terms _Compute Engine instance_, _virtual machine instance_ , _VM instance_, and _VM_ are synonymous. They are used interchangeably in the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), the [`gcloud`](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcloud-compute) command-line tool, and the [REST API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest).

## Introduction

Compute Engine instances can run the [public images](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images) for Linux and Windows Server that Google provides as well as private custom images that you can [create](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/create-delete-deprecate-private-images) or [import from your existing systems](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/import/importing-virtual-disks). You can also [deploy Docker containers](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/containers/deploying-containers), which are automatically launched on instances running the [Container-Optimized OS](https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs) public image.

You can choose the machine properties of your instances, such as the number of virtual CPUs and the amount of memory, by using a set of [predefined machine types](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-resource) or by creating your own [custom machine types](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/creating-instance-with-custom-machine-type).

## Instances and projects

Each instance belongs to a [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) project, and a project can have one or more instances. When you create an instance in a project, you specify the zone, operating system, and machine type of that instance. When you delete an instance, it is removed from the project.

## Instances and storage options

By default, each Compute Engine instance has a small [boot persistent disk](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/create-root-persistent-disks) that contains the operating system. When applications running on your instance require more storage space, you can add additional [storage options](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks) to your instance.

## Instances and networks

Each network interface of a Compute Engine instance is associated with a subnet of a unique VPC network. For more information about VPCs, see [Network overview](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/networking/network-overview) and [VPC quotas](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/quota).

## Instances and containers

Compute Engine instances support a declarative method for launching your applications using [containers](https://cloud.google.com/containers). When creating a VM or an instance template, you can provide a Docker image name and launch configuration. Compute Engine will take care of the rest including supplying an up-to-date [Container-Optimized OS](https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs) image with Docker installed and launching your container when the VM starts up. See [Deploying containers on VMs and managed instance groups (MIGs)](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/containers/deploying-containers) for more information.

## Tools to manage instances

To create and manage instances, you can use a variety of tools, including the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), the [`gcloud`](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcloud-compute) command-line tool, and the [REST API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest). To configure applications on your instances, [connect to the instance](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-to-instance) using Secure Shell (SSH) for Linux instances or Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for Windows Server instances.

## Managing access to your instances

You can manage access to your instances using one of the following methods:

- Linux instances:
    - [Managing instance access using OS login](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/managing-instance-access), which allows you to associate SSH keys with your Google Account or Google Workspace account and manage admin or non-admin access to your instance through IAM roles.
    - [Manage your SSH keys in project or instance metadata](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/connect/add-ssh-keys#metadata), which uses public SSH keys stored in Compute Engine metadata to grant access to the VM. You can use SSH keys stored in project metadata to access all VMs in a project. You can use SSH keys stored in instance metadata to access individual VMs.
    - If you [connect to your instances](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-to-instance#gcetools) using the Google Cloud CLI or SSH from the console, Compute Engine can automatically generate SSH keys for you and apply them to your Google Account or Google Workspace account.
- Windows Server instances:
    - [Generate credentials for Windows VMs](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/windows/generating-credentials), which associates a password with a Windows user. Windows VMs use this information to authenticate access to the VM.
    - [Manage your SSH keys in project or instance metadata](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/connect/add-ssh-keys#metadata), which uses public SSH keys stored in Compute Engine project and instance metadata to grant access to the VM.

## Accessing your instances

After you configure access to your instances, you can use one of many options to [connect to your Linux VMs](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-to-instance) or [connect to your Windows VMs](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-to-windows).

## Default time zone for VM instances

Regardless of the [region](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones) where you create your VM instance, the default time for your VM instance is Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
